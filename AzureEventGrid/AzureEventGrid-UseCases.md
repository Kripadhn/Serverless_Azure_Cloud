Azure Event Grid is a serverless, event-driven messaging service that provides a highly scalable, publish-subscribe model for managing event data. It can be used to build event-driven applications, automate workflows, and integrate services and systems.

Here's a real-world example of how Azure Event Grid can be used:

Use case: A photo-sharing website wants to send an email to users whenever a new photo is added to their account.

Problem: The website needs a reliable, scalable way to manage the event data generated by the addition of new photos, and to trigger an email notification to users.

Solution: The website can use Azure Event Grid to publish an event every time a new photo is added. The event can include information such as the user ID, photo URL, and other relevant details. An Azure Function can be used to subscribe to the event, and when it receives a new event, it can use the Office 365 connection to send an email to the user with the details of the new photo.

Here's a sample code that implements this use case in Azure Event Grid and Azure
