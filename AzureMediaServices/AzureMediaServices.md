Azure Media Services is a cloud-based platform for creating, storing, and delivering video and audio content. It can be used for use-cases such as live streaming, on-demand video, and content management. A real-world use-case for Azure Media Services is a live streaming event, where you want to broadcast a video feed to a large audience over the internet. To implement this, you could use the Azure Media Services API to encode and transmit the video stream, and then use Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network) to distribute the video to your audience.
