Azure Mobile Apps is a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform for building, deploying, and scaling mobile apps. It provides features such as data synchronization, push notifications, and user authentication to make it easy to build scalable and secure mobile apps. A real-world use-case for Azure Mobile Apps is a social networking app, where users can create and manage their profiles, post updates, and connect with friends. To implement this, you could use the Azure Mobile Apps API to manage user authentication, data synchronization, and push notifications, and then use Azure Functions to process incoming data and trigger certain actions based on certain events.
