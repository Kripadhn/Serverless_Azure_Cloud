Azure Notification Hubs is a scalable service for sending push notifications to any platform from any back-end. It provides features such as targeting, personalization, and batching to ensure the efficient delivery of notifications. A real-world use-case for Azure Notification Hubs is a mobile app that needs to send push notifications to users to keep them informed about new content or events. To implement this, you could use the Azure Notification Hubs API to send the push notifications, and then use Azure Functions to trigger the notifications based on certain events.
