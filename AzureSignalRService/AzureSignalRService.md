Azure SignalR Service is a managed service for adding real-time web functionality to your applications. It provides a platform for adding real-time functionality to web and mobile apps, enabling scenarios such as chat, gaming, and collaboration. A real-world use-case for Azure SignalR Service is a chat application, where users can communicate with each other in real-time. To implement this, you could use the Azure SignalR Service API to add real-time functionality to your chat application, and then use Azure Functions to handle incoming messages and broadcast them to all connected clients.
