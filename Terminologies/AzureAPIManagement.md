API Gateway: An API gateway is a reverse proxy that exposes an API to external consumers. Azure API Management is an example of an API gateway.

API Policies: API policies are a series of rules that define how an API is managed, secured, and transformed. Azure API Management supports a wide range of policies, including authentication, rate limiting, caching, and transformation.

Developer Portal: A developer portal is a web site that provides documentation, testing, and other resources for developers who want to consume an API. Azure API Management provides a developer portal that allows developers to discover and learn about the APIs that are exposed through the API gateway.

Products: Products are collections of APIs that are grouped together and exposed through the API gateway. Products can include multiple APIs, and each API can be included in multiple products.

Subscriptions: Subscriptions are the mechanism that allows developers to access and use an API. Developers can subscribe to a product and receive a unique key that they use to access the APIs that are included in that product.
