Event Sourcing: Event sourcing is a software architecture pattern where all changes to an application's state are stored as a sequence of events. This enables the application to reconstruct its current state from the events.

Event-Driven Architecture: Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern where application components communicate with each other through events, rather than through direct request-response communication.

Event-Driven Functions: Functions that are triggered by events and perform a specific task in response to that event.

Event Bus: An event bus is a messaging system that allows components to publish events and subscribe to events. Azure Event Grid is an example of an event bus that can be used to implement event-driven architecture.

Event Store: An event store is a database that stores events and is optimized for event-driven architecture. Azure Cosmos DB is an example of an event store that can be used to implement event-driven architecture.
