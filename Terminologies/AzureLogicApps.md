Workflow: A workflow is a sequence of steps that run in a specific order, such as receiving an email, validating the data, and then updating a database.

Triggers: Triggers in Azure Logic Apps are similar to triggers in Azure Functions, but the trigger logic is defined in the workflow rather than in code.

Actions: Actions are the steps in an Azure Logic App workflow that perform a specific task, such as sending an email, creating a file, or updating a database.

Connectors: Connectors are pre-built integrations with other Azure services, such as Azure Storage, Dynamics 365, and SharePoint, that allow you to easily perform actions in those services as part of your workflow.

API Connections: API Connections allow you to connect to external APIs, such as web services and REST APIs, as part of your workflow.
